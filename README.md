# School-District-Analysis

## Overview of Project

Data analysis was requested to be performed for a city school district that included school spending and standardized test scores. After the initial analysis was completed and presented to the school baord, they were notified of potential academic dishonesty in regards to the reading/math grades for the Thomas High School ninth graders. With consideration of the dishonesty, a second analysis was requested in order to uphold testing standards and keep the other data points intact. 

## Results


* How is the district summary affected?
    * The average math scores decreased by 0.1 points while the reading scores stayed the same. Overall, the passing percentage decreased by 1%.
    
* How is the school summary affected?
    * The most significant change was to Thomas High School where the math and reading decreased. 
    
* How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
    * Thomas High School went from 2nd overall in passing grades (92%) down to last (68%).

* How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:

  * Math and reading scores by grade
  - There are now no math or reading score data. The remainder stayed the same.

  * Scores by school spending
  - The $630-644 bin decreased in the passing percentages, while math and reading scores in that same range remained the same.

  * Scores by school size
  - The Medium bin decreased in passing percentages due to Thomas High School being within the range.

  * Scores by school type
  - The charter schools also decreased as Thomas High School is in that range.
